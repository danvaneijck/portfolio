## Overview

This is the website you're currently browsing. Its main goal is to showcase my work as a software engineer by highlighting key projects I've contributed to, the technologies I've learned, and the lessons I've taken away from each experience.

It also gave me the opportunity to experiment with cutting-edge toolsâ€”particularly large language models. On the About page, you'll find an interactive chatbot powered by the OpenAI API, which can answer questions about my professional background and experience as a software engineer.

## Tech Stack

The site is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It uses **React Router** for navigation and includes a lightweight backend that handles:

- Calls to the **OpenAI API**
- Storage of chatbot session history in a database

This setup allows for a fully interactive, dynamic portfolio experience that merges frontend and backend technologies in a clean and modern stack.
